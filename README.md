Im using an api from ombd and using ajax to send the data to the DOM. Also using html, css, and javascript with some jquary as well.

I started with a different idea and struggled quite a bit with the Ajax and modal. I also had a bit of a hard time remembering the syntax of some of the code and rules of the code. After reviewing video and documentation I felt more at ease and had a better understanding of how to do this project.

I also learn that time doesn't stand still and to plan my time better for next time.
